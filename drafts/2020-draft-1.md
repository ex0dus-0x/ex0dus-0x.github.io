I decided to explore some of the pre-existing security research in attacking the Python data science library numpy

and it's seamless integration through both `libpython` and its foreign function interface,

## How bad is it?

Null pointer dereferences aren't actually security _vulnerabilities_, but are still security-related issues, and can increase in its severity given
a proper context and threat model, as we'll see in a minute. However, unless this is occurring in kernelspace, it's nearly impossible to exploit, since the 0x00000
address space is not marked as executable.


## Doing a Code Audit

Let's use Github's CodeQL to try to analyze this
