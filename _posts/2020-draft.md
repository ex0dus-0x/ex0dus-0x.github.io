I've decided to built a proof-of-concept implementation of a cryptographic scheme that try to implement some of these interesting novelties, and see how cryptography can be pragmatically used to form our efforts in building safer and privacy-preserving technologies.

__Ghostpass__ is a secret management scheme that helps cryptographically secure information, whether they are authentication credentials and secrets in the form of _fields_, or genericized data in the form of _notes_. These

## Textual Steganography

## Plausible Deniability

While we can threat model malicious actors passively to be, we still haven't accounted for Mallory, a dedicated and sophisticated state actor that has knowledge of the underlying steganographic scheme. So let's say that Mallory has built a file scanner, which he can use locally and

This is where _plausible deniability_ comes into play in order to help mitigate that.
