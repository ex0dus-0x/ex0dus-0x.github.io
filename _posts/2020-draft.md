When encumbering ourselves with the intrinisics of various cryptographic schemes and their threat models, we often construct scenarios in attempts to demonstrate various properties, dubbing characters like Alice and Bob, two people who want to securely and privately communicate. We also segregate malicious actors, such as Eve, who eavesdrops on the communication between the two parties, and Mallory, a much more malicious threat that actively tries to hinder the communication in some way.

However, what we've never seemed to anticipate for is the real world, where a character like Mallory isn't just your friendly neigboorhood black-hat hacker, but a threat actor as part of an authoritative and political institution that have capabilities to coerce its people. If perfect secrecy is preserved _as long as_ Alice and Bob don't reveal anything about their secret keys, then what wouldn't incentivize Dystopian Government X to physically force it out of them?

In the light of all this, I've decided to build up a proof-of-concept implementation of

## Textual Steganography

## Plausible Deniability
