## Personal Homepage

This is my personal homepage, served using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for static sites. The theme that the site is derived from is the [forty](https://github.com/andrewbanchich/forty-jekyll-theme) theme.

## Build

`bundle` is used to bootstrap the dependencies and serve the site:

```
$ bundle install --path vendor/bundle
$ bundle exec jekyll build
```
