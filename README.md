## Personal Site

This is my personal site, now running on the [Plain](https://github.com/heiswayi/the-plain)
theme.

If you wish to serve a local version (I don't know why), make sure you have `jekyll`.

    gem install jekyll
    cd /path/to/my/site
    bundle exec jekyll serve

And navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:4000`.
